Every time we try to remember a student’s grades or their parents number but everything just seems too hard to remember especially when we have many classes to teach. How do we confront these challenges as a teacher? Is it possible to combine these two tasks into a single application?
New methods of storing data have been implemented and are revolutionizing the way we collect information. With our cherBook addressbook application, you can solve these two issues at once.
Get the best of both worlds – get to remember your students grades, analyze them, and also contact their parents easily at your fingertips. Download our cherBook for greater convenience.
